Download app folder 

0) Run "npm install" frrom node terminal
1) run "npm login" and insert credentials
2) run "npm i @nishamalik8982/aircrypto"
3) go to node_modules folder and and change the folder "@nishamalik8982" with the folder inside the parent directory (has the same name and contains the updated npm  files) 
4) Run the ionic app (i'm doing "ionic serve" from terminal) 
5) When the app is ready it looks like the one in the picture (appHome.png).
6) Insert email, amount and currency (On the paper I saw it can be both AUD and USD but still USD doesn't work properly)
7) When you choose crypto-top-up as payment method the currency option should appear below
8) After selecting the cryptocurrency and pressing ok the method getQuote will be called (frontend - see file app\src\pages\home\home.ts)
9) The method returns the quoted amount which is displayed on the app (see image quote.png)
10) When you click the confirm button a post request (with payload: email,quoted amount,cryptocurrency) is sent to a server (AirBux, AirCrypto? someone that has out methods createPayment and paymentStatus installed on their backend). I was using another server on localhost just to test
